Still a little work to be done in the "global" device handling.  For
v4lPlugin, we have a global structure (viddevs) which is set up on entry and
cleaned up (devices closed and memory released) during shutdown.  For
netcamPlugin, however, everything is on an individual device basis.  In
particular, we must make certain that netcamCleanup is called to release the
associated structures.
